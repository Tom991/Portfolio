# Embedded AI for IoT

## Description

The “Embedded AI for IoT” course is part of the “Communicating Systems for IoT” module. Its objective is to complement the artificial intelligence courses taught in the 4th year by incorporating the specific constraints of IoT and the principles of Edge AI. The course therefore focuses on adapting machine learning models to resource-constrained environments, as well as on the challenges involved in deploying them on embedded systems.
This course consists of six sessions. First, it aims to consolidate the foundations covered the previous year by reviewing the fundamental principles of AI, in particular the notions of supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as the key steps of an Edge AI workflow. The course then covers data collection, preprocessing, and data representations, before introducing the basics of classification and the associated evaluation methods.
A significant part is devoted to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly useful for IoT applications (vision, detection, embedded classification). Finally, the last sessions address model optimization and compression techniques (size reduction), which are essential to enable AI deployment on embedded devices.
This course was complemented by three practical lab sessions. During the first two, we developed a CNN designed to detect and distinguish falls. The last session was devoted to starting the production of the final video.
The assessment for this course was based both on the submission of a Jupyter notebook, serving as a report, and on an explanatory video presenting our reasoning, the chosen solutions, and the trade-offs made.
