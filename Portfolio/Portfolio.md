# Innovative Project

## Description

<div align="justify">

The portfolio is an assessment and skills valorization approach based on a dossier that brings together the various learning experiences as well as an analysis of the academic pathway. Its objective is to establish a link between the experiences carried out (projects, internships, assessments, etc.) and the competencies targeted by the ISS program.

The main aspect of the portfolio is reflexivity. It involves describing our experiences within a given context, analyzing and explaining the knowledge that was mobilized, and then adopting a critical perspective on oneself in order to perform a self-assessment.

The expected deliverable is structured into four parts. The first, dedicated to general information, provides a brief presentation of the document and the academic pathway. The second is a descriptive section that presents the course unit or subject being analyzed. The third is a technical section in which the situations, encountered problems, and carried-out experiences are described. Finally, the last section is analytical: it presents the acquired competencies as well as a self-assessment of the subject. 

## Technical Aspects

### Report Format

I initially chose to write this report in the form of a simple PDF document. I then decided to convert and structure it using a Git-based format, in order to facilitate the compilation of all documents associated with the report and to avoid an overly heavy and insufficiently scalable structure.

I initially thought that the transition from a Word document to a Git-based format would be quick; however, this process proved to be more time-consuming than expected, particularly due to the need to establish a clear and coherent file organization. Nevertheless, this step allowed me to use a Git tool that I particularly appreciate and that I am increasingly trying to integrate into my working methods. It also enabled me to gain experience in writing documents in Markdown, both in terms of structure and content readability.

### Report Content

I particularly enjoyed writing the descriptive and technical sections of the report. These sections allowed me to revisit certain course concepts and to present work that I carried out during the program.

The analytical section, however, proved to be more challenging to write. I had to revise it several times in order to obtain a satisfactory result. Nonetheless, I observe a progression throughout the report. This section sometimes remains too close to the technical part, as the two are naturally linked. 

Justifying certain competencies based on technical elements without redundantly re-explaining them proved to be difficult. In this respect, I consider this section to be the one that presents the most limitations in the report, but also the one that contributed the most to my development in terms of reflexive thinking

Through the innovative project, I was able to analyze several real-world problems stemming from a general issue that led to numerous sub-problems. This analysis phase enabled us to make coherent design choices, in order to adapt the proposed solutions to the technical and time constraints of the project. I also realized that defining realistic objectives at the beginning of a project is essential, particularly given the limited time available.

|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| G. Loubet     | Suggest a technological solution to a problem | 4 / 4 | report/presentation |

Based on this analysis, we proposed an initial technological solution while anticipating and managing new issues that arose throughout the course of the project. For example, after discussions with our supervisors, we opted for a communication system based on a GSM module. This choice required us to study its operation in detail, as well as the constraints and difficulties it introduced. We were then able to propose a set of technical solutions to address these issues.

|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| G. Loubet     | Implement a prototype to solve the problem | 4 / 4 | prototype |

All of our solutions were based on the development of prototypes, which we progressively implemented as the identified solutions evolved. Initially, we used a GSM board combined with a level shifter to adapt voltage levels. Subsequently, this architecture evolved with the integration of an Arduino, which allowed us to debug the communication more efficiently and validate certain technical assumptions.

| G. Loubet     | Present and debate (in English) the technical choice made | 4 / 4 | presentation |

The project required us to regularly present the progress of our work in English. These presentations allowed me to improve my ability to clearly explain technical concepts and justify our architectural choices. Discussions with the teachers also helped to challenge certain decisions and refine our technical approaches.
