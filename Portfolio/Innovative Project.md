# Innovative Project

## Description

<div align="justify">

The Innovative Project is a central component of the ISS program. It is a project whose objective is to mobilize and apply a wide range of ISS skills developed throughout the year. To achieve this, we were divided into groups of four people.

I chose to work on the Quadruped Robot project. This project was initially based on a microcontroller-based architecture; the new version adopts an FPGA-based architecture, offering a more efficient, reduced architecture with improved energy efficiency.

During this project, we had two main tasks. The first consisted of establishing remote communication with the robot in order to apply the concepts studied in communication systems. The second aimed to set up a camera to build an elevation map, allowing the robot to be aware of its environment and adapt its movements accordingly.

To move forward with this project, we delivered several presentations during English classes, following an agile methodology. These presentations enabled us to present the different stages of progress and to exchange with our teachers in order to receive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Technical Aspects

During this project, I was able to design, as mentioned in the AI section, a generic MPL for the FPGA. I then attempted to establish communication between the FPGA and a GSM board, with the aim of remotely controlling the robot via a cloud-based solution.

This project allowed me to mobilize and develop new skills, particularly related to the Vitis environment, which is used to program the Processing System (PS) part of the FPGA. This experience helped me gain a better understanding of FPGA architecture and the interaction between the hardware and software components of the system.

I particularly enjoyed this project, even though the time allocated was largely insufficient to achieve all the set objectives. In order to make further progress, I had to dedicate a significant number of hours to personal work.

Through the innovative project, I was able to analyze several real-world problems stemming from a general issue that led to numerous sub-problems. This analysis phase enabled us to make coherent design choices, in order to adapt the proposed solutions to the technical and time constraints of the project. I also realized that defining realistic objectives at the beginning of a project is essential, particularly given the limited time available.

| T. Monteil     | Suggest a technological solution to a problem | 4 / 4 | report/presentation |

Based on this analysis, we proposed an initial technological solution while anticipating and managing new issues that arose throughout the course of the project. For example, after discussions with our supervisors, we opted for a communication system based on a GSM module. This choice required us to study its operation in detail, as well as the constraints and difficulties it introduced. We were then able to propose a set of technical solutions to address these issues.

|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| T. Monteil     | Implement a prototype to solve the problem | 4 / 4 | prototype |


All of our solutions were based on the development of prototypes, which we progressively implemented as the identified solutions evolved. Initially, we used a GSM board combined with a level shifter to adapt voltage levels. Subsequently, this architecture evolved with the integration of an Arduino, which allowed us to debug the communication more efficiently and validate certain technical assumptions.

| T. Monteil     | Present and debate (in English) the technical choice made | 4 / 4 | presentation |


The project required us to regularly present the progress of our work in English. These presentations allowed me to improve my ability to clearly explain technical concepts and justify our architectural choices. Discussions with the teachers also helped to challenge certain decisions and refine our technical approaches.
