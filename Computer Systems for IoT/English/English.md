# 5G Technologies

## Description

<div align="justify">

5G instruction is part of the Computer Systems for IoT teaching unit. It focuses on the evolution of mobile communication technologies, from the earliest networks to the perspectives offered by 6G. Its objective is to enable us to understand cellular architectures, telecommunication standards, and the technological, economic, and societal challenges associated with these evolutions.

The course begins by retracing the history of mobile networks, explaining how the growing demand for connectivity has led to successive improvements in terms of data rate, latency, and coverage. It presents the fundamental principles related to the frequencies used and wave propagation, as well as the physical constraints that influence the design of antennas and mobile network infrastructures. The final part of the course is dedicated to the 6G roadmap, drawing on the visions of major industrial players. It highlights the challenges that must be addressed to achieve the desired performance levels.

This module is complemented by student presentations on a wide range of topics, from 5G and 6G technologies to health issues, smartphone addiction, and environmental impact. Assessment is based on the quality of the presentations, the clarity of the analyses, and the ability to broaden the discussion toward future technologies.

## Technical Aspects

This English module aims to develop our scientific and technical communication skills in English, both orally and in writing. Its main objective is to enable us to effectively convey scientific and technical knowledge in English, while being able to adapt our language to different types of audiences, whether specialized or non‑specialized.

Throughout this module, we gave several oral presentations in English, which allowed us to present and follow the progress of our innovative project while gradually improving our oral fluency and scientific vocabulary.

The assessment of this module is divided into three parts. First, four project reviews, assessed individually, each count for 10% of the final grade. Then, a group written report focusing on the innovative project represents 25% of the final grade. Finally, a final oral presentation, also assessed individually, accounts for 35% of the final grade.


During the first session, we completed the Spaghetti Challenge, an activity consisting of building the tallest possible structure within a limited time using dry spaghetti and a marshmallow. Beyond its playful aspect, this exercise highlighted the importance of communication within a team. Indeed, a lack of communication often leads to failure, while excessive discussion without decision‑making results in a loss of time.

As part of this module, we then gave several presentations following the Agile methodology. We therefore worked through successive iterations, progressively enriching the project as it advanced.

A first sprint (Sprint 0) was dedicated to presenting the context, objectives, and work plan. This session allowed us to refocus on the main issues and better define the project objectives.

Sprints 1 to 4 then made it possible to present the successive improvements made to the project, with the last sprint serving as a complete final presentation.

Throughout the semester, we were able to work continuously on both the presentations and the project between the different sprints.

## Analytical

Through this course, I was able to develop and apply a set of skills in both written and oral communication. The various presentations required me to clearly structure my ideas. During the presentations, I had to justify my technical choices and compare several possible solutions.

The question‑and‑answer sessions sometimes put me in difficulty, but they helped me learn how to respond more calmly, reformulate questions, and provide more structured answers, even when I did not immediately have a solution.

Writing the report allowed me to improve my written expression and to build a coherent line of reasoning. Although writing in English remains slower and requires more effort than in French, I observed a clear improvement in the clarity of my texts. My English is still imperfect, but this course helped me reduce errors that hinder comprehension.

Finally, the feedback on my oral presentations enabled me to identify recurring mistakes, reduce unnecessary hesitations such as « euuhh », and pay closer attention to grammar and vocabulary.
