# 5G Technologies

## Description

<div align="justify">

5G instruction is part of the Computer Systems for IoT teaching unit. It focuses on the evolution of mobile communication technologies, from the earliest networks to the perspectives offered by 6G. Its objective is to enable us to understand cellular architectures, telecommunication standards, and the technological, economic, and societal challenges associated with these evolutions.

The course begins by retracing the history of mobile networks, explaining how the growing demand for connectivity has led to successive improvements in terms of data rate, latency, and coverage. It presents the fundamental principles related to the frequencies used and wave propagation, as well as the physical constraints that influence the design of antennas and mobile network infrastructures. The final part of the course is dedicated to the 6G roadmap, drawing on the visions of major industrial players. It highlights the challenges that must be addressed to achieve the desired performance levels.

This module is complemented by student presentations on a wide range of topics, from 5G and 6G technologies to health issues, smartphone addiction, and environmental impact. Assessment is based on the quality of the presentations, the clarity of the analyses, and the ability to broaden the discussion toward future technologies.

## Technical Aspects

As this course was not associated with tutorials, practical sessions, or a concrete project, the knowledge acquired during the teaching period was not directly put into practice.

However, we carried out a pair-based presentation [TL5.1], in which we chose to address the topic of satellite constellations. This work enabled me to explore the technical aspects of these systems, in particular their architecture, operating principles, and associated technologies.

Beyond the technical aspects, this presentation also provided an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the economic and strategic issues related to these systems. Finally, we addressed certain geopolitical and competitive implications, highlighting the race between private and public actors for the control of space.

As part of the innovative project, I had the opportunity to implement a remote communication solution between an FPGA and a 3G board. This experience allowed me to practically exploit a 3G network using the SIM5215 module by configuring its parameters and attempting to ensure reliable data transmission. Through this work, I deepened my knowledge of mobile communication protocols, data exchange management in embedded environments, and the constraints related to GSM connectivity.

Through the various student presentations I attended covering both 5G and 6G technologies as well as cross-disciplinary topics such as the potential effects of new networks on health and the gradual phase-out of 2G I was able to gain a more comprehensive and critical view of the issues and challenges related to the evolution of mobile networks.

These works made it possible to address not only technological advances and the expected performance gains, but also the societal, regulatory, and industrial impacts associated with the deployment of new generations of networks.

They thus helped me to take a step back from the technological choices being made, to identify the constraints related to the coexistence of multiple network generations, and to better understand the consequences of these evolutions on usage patterns, existing infrastructures, and end users.
