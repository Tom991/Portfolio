# Emerging networks

## Description

<div align="justify">

The Emerging Networks course, integrated into the Wireless Communication teaching unit, aims to present the major evolutions in network architectures and, in particular, to explain why network programmability has become a central issue. In this context, the course quickly focuses on the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, which proposes separating the control plane from the data plane in order to manage the network in a centralized manner using a controller.

The course consists of four lecture sessions and two practical lab sessions. The lectures form the theoretical core of the module and are mainly dedicated to SDN. They present the fundamental principles of the separation between the data plane and the control plane, as well as the role and operation of an SDN controller. The course also introduces OpenFlow as an interface and communication protocol that enables the controller to control network devices, and outlines its main benefits and use cases.

The teaching is complemented by two practical lab sessions, focused on the implementation and programming of SDN networks. These labs allow students to manipulate the concepts presented in the lectures, to experiment with the control of network devices, and to gain a better understanding of programmable networks.
Finally, assessment is based on a quiz as well as an analytical activity in the form of a questionnaire.
