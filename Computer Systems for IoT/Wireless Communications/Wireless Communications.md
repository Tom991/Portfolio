# Communication Protocols for LP‑WPAN

## Description

<div align="justify">

The Communication Protocols for LP-WPAN course is part of the EU Wireless Communications program. It focuses on communication technologies and network protocols that enable the connection of intrinsically constrained IoT objects in terms of energy consumption, data rate, and frame size within wireless networks, in particular LP-WPANs (Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks). Special attention is given to the Internet protocol stack based on IPv6 for IoT networks.

The course first introduces the application requirements related to IoT. It then presents the fundamentals of LP-WPANs and the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, as well as the architectures defined by the IETF for IoT, based on the combination of IPv6, 6LoWPAN, and RPL, in order to enable their integration into constrained networks of the LP-WAN type.

The course is complemented by hands-on experimental activities aimed at implementing and observing IPv6 mechanisms, and then exploiting this connectivity to carry out application-level communications.

The teaching is organized around three lecture sessions and three tutorial sessions.

Assessment is based on homework assignments including a Moodle quiz, as well as a questionnaire serving as input to this part of the report, which focuses on the key principles of an IP-based IoT architecture and on the mechanisms that make IPv6 usable in LP-WPAN networks, notably through 6LoWPAN and the RPL routing protocol.
