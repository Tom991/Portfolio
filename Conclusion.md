# Conclusion

The purpose of this report was to present and analyze the skills acquired throughout the year, demonstrating their alignment with the educational objectives of the program. It serves as a means of showcasing my academic path by highlighting the theoretical knowledge gained, the practical skills developed, and their real-world application.

Over the course of the year, I developed numerous technical skills. I became particularly aware of this progress during the innovative project, in which I was able to draw on a large portion of the knowledge acquired as part of the PTP program. This project provided a concrete view of the skills developed across various fields: middleware, through the use of the MQTT protocol for inter-system communication; security, particularly in securing the user interface; and artificial intelligence, through the study and implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP).

Beyond technical skills, this year also enabled me to develop transversal and methodological competencies. In particular, I improved and deepened my use of Git by adopting a more rigorous approach to collaborative work organization. These learnings allowed me to increase both efficiency and quality in the development of my projects.

I believe I made the right choice in terms of specialization for the final stage of my studies. Indeed, the comprehensive nature of the PTP program—covering both very low-level aspects such as sensor design and higher-level topics such as virtualization—was particularly appealing to me. I greatly appreciated this multidisciplinary approach, especially during the innovative project, which involved FPGA development. This project required taking hardware constraints into account in order to design suitable software.

I believe that the skills I developed throughout the year are well aligned with the expectations of the PTP program. I feel that I have progressed steadily and have been able to practically apply a large portion of the theoretical knowledge acquired during this training.

Finally, the work involved in writing the portfolio proved to be relatively long and sometimes demanding. However, this exercise allowed me to step back from my academic journey, assess the skills I have truly acquired, and more clearly identify areas for improvement. As such, it represents an important step in my professional reflection and in the development of my career project.
