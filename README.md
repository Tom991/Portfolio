# Repository Overview

This Git repository was designed as a portfolio gathering all documents, reports, and resources related to the different subjects of the ISS - Innovative Smart Systems program.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized around three main directories, corresponding to the major areas of the ISS program:

* Communicating Systems for IoT
* Computer Systems for IoT
* Portfolio

Each of these directories contains folders associated with the different EUs (Teaching Units). Within each EU, you will find the presentation of the portfolio related to the subject, as well as reports or presentations.

The Git repository also includes the Portfolio directory containing the innovative project and portfolio sections.

### Report

The final portfolio report is also available in PDF format directly within this Git repository, to facilitate consultation and sharing.
